### Research questions
* Do the musical preferences of the residents of the two Russian megacities of Moscow and St. Petersburg differ?
* Is the music that sounds on the way to work on Monday morning different from the one that plays on Wednesday or at the end of the workweek?

### Research plan
* Collect Data. Read the data, read it.
* Data Cleaning. Get rid of duplicates, problems with column names and omissions.
* Data analysis. Answer the main questions of the study, prepare a reporting table or describe the result.
* Summarizing. Review the work done and draw conclusions.

### Data Description
* userID -> user_id
* Track -> track_name
* artist -> artist_name
* genre -> genre_name
* City -> city
* time -> time
* Day -> weekday

### Research Results

**Hypotheses:**<br>
* Music in two cities - Moscow and St. Petersburg - listen in different modes;
* Lists of the ten most popular genres on Monday morning and Friday evening have characteristic differences;
* The population of the two cities prefers different musical genres.

**General results**<br>

Moscow and St. Petersburg agree on tastes: popular music prevails everywhere. At the same time, there is no dependence of preferences on the day of the week in each individual city - people constantly listen to what they like. But between the cities, in terms of days a week, there is specularity relative to the environment: Moscow listens more on Monday and Friday, and Petersburg, on the contrary, more on Wednesday, but less on Monday and Friday.

As a result, 
- the first hypothesis - specify confirmed, 
- the second hypothesis - indicate confirmed,
- the third - indicate confirmed.
